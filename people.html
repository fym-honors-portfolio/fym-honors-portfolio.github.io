            I came to the University of Washington early for the Early Fall Start and took <em>Indistinguishable from Magic: New Technologies, Science, and Us</em> partly to meet new people and become acclimated to this new enviornment and I am so glad I did. EFS did everything I wanted it to but I am especially thankful for the people who came into my life from it. I have never created such a strong and lasting bond with a group of people as I did through EFS and know that these are people in my life that will stay. I love the slightly chaotic energy from this group and how they've encouraged me to be be my best self. As a result, I have and will continue to recommend the EFS option to everyone that chooses to attend UW.
