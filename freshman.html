I worked in the setup and registration portion of the day and met some nice people working in the tech industry. Following this, I went to the ICPC 2018 Event here with two friends for the experience rather than to be competitive and I am happy to say it was a very positive experience. We learned a lot about how the process works and are excited to pursue more competitions. </div>

                I came to the University of Washington early for the Early Fall Start and took <em>Indistinguishable from Magic: New Technologies, Science, and Us</em> partly to meet new people and become acclimated to this new enviornment and I am so glad I did. EFS did everything I wanted it to but I am especially thankful for the people who came into my life from it. I have never created such a strong and lasting bond with a group of people as I did through EFS and know that these are people in my life that will stay. I love the slightly chaotic energy from this group and how they've encouraged me to be be my best self. As a result, I have and will continue to recommend the EFS option to everyone that chooses to attend UW.

                I joined ReThink this freshman year as the Vice President of Events and am super excited to see where my involvement in this club takes me. I hope to have a lasting impact on the future of the club as right now I am working to organize a new annual event of a Hackathon to engage more people in our mission outside of the enviornment and business disciplines. By braodening our reach, I think it would prove beneficial to the longevity of this club because the mission is very important.
